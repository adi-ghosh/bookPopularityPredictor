main.py: data reading, model building, training and saving
predict.py: predict a new book's rate
data_list.txt: each book's path
rate.txt: rate (average score) of different books

###how to read data:
The main.py read path of each book from data_list.txt and score rate.txt
book's path in data_list.txt must matching with scores in rate.txt

###how ro train:
simply run main.py will train

###where the trained model saved?
../model
default saved as model1.keras

###how to predict
run predict.py
!!!Pending for now!!!

###Config the environment
There is a requirements.txt which records the environment i am using locally. When deploy on HPC, run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
To install the same environment as mine.
So library may cannot be installed successfully, doesn't matter, there are serval unnecessary libs in my conda env
Mainly tensorflow 2.3.0 will works, hopefully

Any issues, text me any time
